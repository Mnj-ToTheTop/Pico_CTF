# Tab, Tab, Attack

## Overview
  Points: 20

## Description
  Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: `Addadshashanammu.zip`

## Solution
  I downloaded the file `Addadshashanammu.zip` and unziped it using the `unzip` command.
  I started transversing the folder present within it. Since the mnames of the folders were long and winding I used that `tab` button to autocomplete the names of the folder as the description suggested.
  At the end I encountered a file named `fang-o-f-haynekhtmet`. On opening the file using the cat command, I fund out that it consisted of random characters.
  To search for the flag i again used the `grep` command.
