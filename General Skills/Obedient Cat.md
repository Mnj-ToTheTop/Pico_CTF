## Descriptions
  Points: 5
  Description: This file has a flag in plain sight (aka “in-the-clear”).

## Solution
  As the description tells us, the flag should be present in the file provided to us. We simply need to open the file and get the flag.
  To do this, we’ll use wget command to download the given file to our console and then use cat command to open the file and get our flag.
